            Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, was a
            remarkable leader who dedicated his life to the principles of truth,
            non-violence, and justice. He played a pivotal role in India's
            struggle for independence from British rule and inspired movements for
            civil rights and freedom across the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gandhi's admirable qualities included his unwavering commitment to
            peace and his ability to bring about change through non-violent means.
            He believed in the power of civil disobedience, and his teachings of
            truth and tolerance continue to influence leaders and activists to
            this day.

          <h3>Youth</h3>
          <p>
            Gandhi was the youngest child of his father’s fourth wife. His
            father—Karamchand Gandhi, who was the dewan (chief minister) of
            Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in western India (in
            what is now Gujarat state) under British suzerainty—did not have much
            in the way of a formal education. He was, however, an able
            administrator who knew how to steer his way between the capricious
            princes, their long-suffering subjects, and the headstrong British
            political officers in power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gandhi’s mother, Putlibai, was completely absorbed in religion, did
            not care much for finery or jewelry, divided her time between her home
            and the temple, fasted frequently, and wore herself out in days and
            nights of nursing whenever there was sickness in the family. Mohandas
            grew up in a home steeped in Vaishnavism—worship of the Hindu god
            Vishnu—with a strong tinge of Jainism, a morally rigorous Indian
            religion whose chief tenets are nonviolence and the belief that
            everything in the universe is eternal. Thus, he took for granted
            ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings), vegetarianism, fasting for
            self-purification, and mutual tolerance between adherents of various
            creeds and sects.
